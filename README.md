# TFM - A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH FOR THE PREDICTION OF AIRCRAFT VALUE DEPRECIATION

This repository includes the scripts and resources developed for the implementation of a regression machine learning capable of predicting aircraft prices. This work has been developed for the
composition of the final Master Thesis of the author, associated with Universidad Europea de Madrid.
